ðŸ§ª Quest 3 Depth Texture + Compute Shader Example (Unity)

Hey fellow interns! ðŸ‘‹
This repo is an example I put together to show how to:

Access the Quest 3's depth texture

Launch a compute shader

Read data back from the GPU in Unity

Simple Visualization for depth Tex

The idea is to use this as a base for building a point cloud from depth data. If I get time, I might also explore different ways of rendering points efficiently in Unity.
